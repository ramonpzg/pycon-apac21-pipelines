    "If you have ever created machine learning pipelines of any kind and wondered if it would be possible to combine your data, feature engineering, training and model saving in one single place where you could experiment to your heart's content, üê≥, look no further as it possible with DVC and you will learn about it here. The aim of this tutorial is to show you a step-by-step process for creating reproducible pipelines to gather, clean, train, evaluate, and track machine learning models with DVC (data version control), and other tools in the Data Science stack. By the end of this tutorial, you will have the tools to create your own reproducible pipelines and keep track not only of your code but also of your data."

The reason beign that dvc has a special function that allows us to compare the diff of metrics between those in a branch and those in master or those between different commits, and as you'll see soon, this is a very powerful feature of dvc that we certainly want to take advantage of."

    "DVC pipelines is one of the best features offered by dvc. They allow us to create reproducible workflows containing anything from getting the data to training and evaluating models.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways for creating pipelines with dvc and here we'll do so with `dvc run`. `dvc run` starts with the `-n` flag followed by the name we want to give to the step of the pipeline we want to create. Next, we add the `-d` flag to signal dependencies such as the python file we want to run as well as any arguments that such file takes. Next we have the `-o` flag, which tells dvc the output expected from such step of the pipeline. For example, this stage would take the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files from the data preparation stage. Lastly, you need to pass the full python call without any flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we run our dvc command we'll get 2 files, a `dvc.yaml` and a `dvc.lock` file. The former contains the stages dvc will follow in our pipeline, and the latter contains the metadata and other information regarding our pipeline. Once you have a look at the yaml file, you'll probably wonder if you can create such a file manually, the answer is yes. For the `dvc.lock` on the other hand, dvc will take care of that one through the command `dvc repro`, which runs whatever pipeline resides in your `dvc.yaml` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information about both can be found in the official documentation site [here](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/run).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start adding the stages of our pipeline, let's first remove the files we were already tracking with dvc. Not doing so will result in dvc giving us an error since the tracked files already exist, and also, we want to see how the whole pipeline behaves."
